**Note:** This is part of a series, click here for the rest of it. 

What follows below is a parts list for a generic kit that anyone could use, stock, and make available. The list below names the part or piece and then gives a little explanation of why I made the choices I did about what to include. Anyone should feel free to include or exclude according to their desires, the kit is meant to be built upon and hacked, not necessarily copied. None of the pieces in the parts list below are absolutely necessary and sometimes not having something leads to an interesting hack. For instance, not having the boards makes for interesting issues about where to situate the board game exactly. Could be the desk, could be the floor, could be somewhere else.

The costs are close estimates, but not bang on.  

- Pack of six small 8" x 8" foam boards ($5 per pack of 5)
	- (as I note above, not essential. But, these foam boards are great because they accept ink, you can stick pins in them, cut holes in there, but they're sturdy enough to hold up under pressure). They're also cheap at around $5 for a pack of 5, which means in a class of 35 you're working with a manageable group of 7 students per game board. Or, if you pony-up and get two packs, 3-4 students per board. 
- Set of 4 large wooden people
	- 
- Set of 12 little wooden people
- Assorted Dollhouse things: so gendered as to be hilarious... can get expensive fast.

	- Rotary Telephone
	- Boxes of food
	- Knives and forks
	- Cans of food
	- Pots and pains
- Deck of 100 Cue Cards
	- Yr basic deck
- Pins
- Post-Its (If you want to re-use the kit, you can make the students plot out the game using the post-its. At the same time, if you don't want to use the foam boards or a base, the post-its give a gameplay option... vertical game anyone? 

- Stickers (no real statement here, other than that they should be a different shape than the post-its. If you get round post-its, don't get round stickers). 
- Protractor Angles (set of 4) (2 set squares, a 180° protractor, a 15 cm ruler - you can include the metal compass if you like too, but I went with the $3.00 math set that includes 180 degree protractor, 6"/150 mm plastic ruler, 60 degree set square and 45 degree set square )
- Sculpting Putty
- Dice
- LEGO (verticality)
- String
- Case

Cost of one generic kit, which would do a class of 35 for a session: $50 (not including the case) 

I was careful not to include anything overtly or symbolically literary. No books, or glasses, or pages of poetry. 

Tried to include things that: 

- represent gender or power structures and dynamics
- keep pieces that represent people as neutral as possible. Faceless.

**You've Noted "Board Game" a Lot, Why a Board Game?**

I want to distinguish this kit from the development of a video game because I want the result to be physically material. This is not to say that it couldn't be translated into a video game assignment--it certainly could and has already been.

**Conclusion:**

There may well be extensions and manipulations of the process I have noted above. Hopefully, there are--this isn't meant to be prescriptive. I also hope there are faults in my theoretical underpinnings or assumptions that others can exploit to make the kit better or more compelling for different audiences. I encourage the remixing and dismantling of what I have built--indeed, that is one of the governing principles of the approach.

**Part II: The Assembly**

There are a few rules when undertaking the task of building a board game as a material realization of literary interpretation. While the rules are malleable, and can change, there should be an outcome or thesis to the board game's design principle. In this prototype case, I'm interested in representing how we interpret the interplay between character and setting (or, how representations are representative... ummm). That said, I am also wanting to explore how elements of the passage below can articulate this interplay. Basically, I am performing the classic literary interpretation exercise: take a passage of a text and put forward a claim for how it makes meaning and, if possible, the embedded or underlying structures and socio-cultural assumptions the passage exploits. However, instead of writing an essay, I am building a board game. 

Now, the similarities between the building and designing of a board game and writing an essay I note above shouldn't be taken as parallel activities. The board game is not meant to be "like" an essay or a substitute for an essay. Instead, the board game is a different process for realizing similar ends to the essay--approaching issues of setting, character, and theme through interpretation and argument. Unlike the essay, where the thesis is stated explicitly, the thesis of the board game is the game itself--the way one chooses to represent the passage in the design of the board game is the argument. Or, and here's where it gets interesting, the argument could also be contained in the gameplay--how one plays the game reveals the argument. One of the attractions of the board game for literary interpretation kit is that it encourages a number of different paths through argumentation. At the same time, the process of designing, building, and playing the board game offer different entry points for argumentative discussion, for both the makers and the players--why are choices being made, what happens in the assembly of the game, why make players play this way? 

At the same time, the board game can be hijacked. ((((((SEE READINGS HERE)))))

One of the ways we can see embedded assumptions comes from my own as they are loaded into the game design--the carded digressions to "read Dashell Hammett and miss a turn" come out of a familiarity with *Monopoly*-type games with a "go-to-jail" component. 



**Parts List (I'll go into the rationales behind these choices in a bit, just the list for now):**

- 3D printing files for the bookshelves were made by @l7arkness (or Lucas Smith) and found on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1868545/#files)
- Paint--I used only green, red (sometimes mixed to make brown), white, and black
	- "red clay" and "dark moss"
- One board (I used wood canvasses)
- One Arduino
- Wires (again only green, red, white, black--rules!)
- A lazy-susan apparatus made out of:
	- "I give the 3-D bookstore a push with the trackpad and set it spinning on its axes."
	- "the bookstore is still spinning, whirling like a carousel … and something strange is happening."
- Cardstock
	- "I stand up to stretch my legs. On the other side of the desk, I pick up one of the Dashiell Hammetts, untouched by anyone since I noticed them that first day in the store. That’s sad. I mean, seriously: shelves full of gibberish get all the attention while The *Maltese Falcon* gathers dust? It’s beyond sad. It’s stupid. I should start looking for a different job. // This place will drive me nuts."
- Linotype board, with ink and tools (or get a rubber stamp made).
	- Rubber stamp with Maltese Falcon in it? - the cards symbolize diversion

**Why Did You Make Those Choices?**

Well, now I need to introduce the passage, so here it is: 

---

>Now: I’m dealing with too much information here. I only want to see who borrowed what. Kat’s analysis was smart enough to tag names and titles and times in the text, and the visualization knows how to plot those, so I link data to display and I see something familiar: a swarm of colored lights bouncing through the shelves, each one representing a customer. These, though, are customers from years ago.

>It doesn’t look like much—just a colorful mess migrating through the Waybacklist. Then, on a hunch, I connect the dots, so it’s not a swarm but a set of constellations. Every customer leaves a trail, a drunken zigzag through the shelves. The shortest constellation, rendered in red clay, makes a tiny Z, just four data points. The longest, in dark moss, curves around the whole width of the store in a long jagged oval.

>It still doesn’t look like much. I give the 3-D bookstore a push with the trackpad and set it spinning on its axes. I stand up to stretch my legs. On the other side of the desk, I pick up one of the Dashiell Hammetts, untouched by anyone since I noticed them that first day in the store. That’s sad. I mean, seriously: shelves full of gibberish get all the attention while The *Maltese Falcon* gathers dust? It’s beyond sad. It’s stupid. I should start looking for a different job. 

>This place will drive me nuts.

>When I come back to the desk, the bookstore is still spinning, whirling like a carousel … and something strange is happening. Once every rotation, the dark moss constellation snaps into focus. For just a moment, it makes a picture and—it can’t be. I smack my hand on the trackpad, slow the model to a halt, and bring it back around. The dark moss constellation makes a clear picture. The other constellations fit, too. None of them are as complete as the dark moss, but they follow the curve of a chin, the slope of an eye. When the model is lined up straight, as if I were peering in from the front door—very close to where I’m sitting right now—the constellations come to life. They make a face.

>It’s Penumbra.

This piece should really be titled 3 ways of looking at chess board. 

**The Education Game:**

**Version One**

1. Adminstration occupies high roles (more mobility, limited representation) King / Queen
2. Faculty Mid roles (restricted mobility, more representation) Rooks, Knights, Bishops
3. pawns students (very restricted mobilitly, lots of representation)

**Version Two**

1. Faculty occupies high role
2. Administration mid role
3. Students pawns

**Version Three**

1. Students occupy high role
2. Faculty mid role
3. Administration pawns

**Version Four**

1. Admin
2. Students
3. Fac

**Version Five**

1. Student
2. Admin
3. Fac



"In organized play and games, rules have a mechanical rigor and are followed as procedures. These take on a kind of algorithmic specificity as players enact meaning through following rule sets. In this way, technological change has been interlinked with changes in play and gaming practices" (Flanagan 8).

"Critical play means to create or occupy play environments and activities that represent one or more questions about aspects of human life" (Flanagan 6)

"Criticality can provide an essential viewpoint or an analytical framework. Those using critical play as an approach might create a platform of rules by which to examine a specific issue--rules that would be somehow relevant to the issue itself. Critical play is characterized by a careful examination of social, cultural, political, or even personal themes that function as alternates to popular play spaces" (Flanagan 6).  

Flanagan define activist games as "Activist games can be characterized by their emphasis on social issues, education, and, occasionally, intervention. In other words, they are not purely conceptual exercises, but rather, games that engage in a social issue through, most commonly, themes, narratives, roles, settings, goals, and characters; and less commonly, through game mechanics, play paradigms, interactions, or win states to benefit and intended outcome beyond a game's entertainment or experiential value alone" (Flanagan 13). This is a justification for using games to study literature and help examine the collision between technology and humanities. Designing the game is a technology. 

"There is something about designing play, especially the process of conceptualizing and making games, that requires an attention to possibility" (Flanagan 252)

As in art, the creation of play and games necessitates rule making at a fundamental level. Even simple role-playing activities, or playing house, both seemingly limitless open-play scenarios, include implicit or explicit rules that establish behaviour, possible actions, environments, and the safe zone for play itself" (Flanagan 252)

"Like activists, game designers also follow an overall scheme of investigation or research, creating processes to address specific concerns and ideas. In addition, the creation of rules of operation makes interesting constraints to provoke innovation in both the designer's process and the player's role" (Flanagan 252).

"[Networked computer games] must be seen as spaces of translation, already transformed by game designers and the growing number of game players: international, transbordered, fluid" (Flanagan 253)..... "now, more than ever, electronic games constitute cultural spaces" (Flanagan 253).

[Langdon Winner (do artifacts have politics?)](http://0-www.jstor.org.orca.douglascollege.ca/stable/pdf/20024652.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A235f643e43a5ac701bc9c5aa794d4a70) 

"games are simultaneously systems of information, cultural products, and manifestations of cultural practice. [...] systems such as games must, due to the conditions of their creation, represent cultural norms and biases in their realization" (Flanagan 254).

"what is distinctive about play is that one cannot always easily see that a clear boundary exists between it and social reality, or rather, see that play uses the tools of everyday reality in its construction" (Flanagan 254).

"The disruption of contemporary games, whether through play, or preferably, through original designs that eschew the embedded interaction style of current computer games may offer models for other emerging practices in playculture. Designer actions are powerful sites of empowerment for giving a voice to marginalized groups" (Flanagan 256)

"Games are artifacts of historical and cultural importance, but they are also something *beyond artifact* in that games also function as a set of activities that carry conventions like audience role, interaction, currency, and exchange" (Flanagan 259).

 




I'm using this medium to track the development of these kits. I am not sure where I am actually going to store the kits. 

I think I should store the instructions either on paper or in the library... actually catalogued with the index. Like in the "book" section. I can make a .pdf of the stuff and then provide a link to somewhere in the library catalogue that holds the files for the code.

Booklet for students
The essay about it coming together



Let's first define the terms: 

Game

Play

Rules



- Imitation (labour of the text): to better understand the composition of a text by learning the techniques involved in its production;
- Forgery (economy of the text): to better understand the public perception and/or value of a text by learning the techniques involved in its production, but with intent to either deceive or reveal deception;
- Scenario (interaction with the text): to better understand how people may ultimately interpret a text by situating it in contexts of use and then observing those uses;
- Story (performance of the text): to better understand how a text gains cultural traction or builds identity by treating it as a script and performing it on or off record;
- Counterfactual (norms or conditions of the text): to better understand the biases of a text (or common interpretations of it) by constructing "what-if" alternatives to specific aspects of its history, content, or composition (see Bonsignore et al.);
- Model (logic or conventions of the text): to better understand the mode, form, genre, scale, or design of a text by rendering it an abstraction, using it to alter other texts (or aspects of itself), and determining why the changes are interesting (if at all);
- Glitch (negotiations with the text): to better understand hiccups or surprises in a text by isolating them, applying them procedurally or randomly to other texts (or aspects of itself), and determining why the changes are interesting (if at all); and
- Wish (ideology of the text): to better understand the worldviews, belief systems, or desires of a text by increasing/decreasing their frequency, reversing them, or otherwise manipulating them and then determing why the changes are interesting (if at all).


**Point 1:** The real issue with developing these kits is not so much figuring out what the students will do, but rather figuring out what prototype to build for them. One must be mindful of how the prototype will influence future work. The impetus is often to create the most amazing prototype ever, but in reality a terrible prototype that holds no threat of amazingness is actually what's needed. 

**Point 2:** What does doing this add in terms of value? Applied learning or learning by doing rather than by mimicry or memorization. Moving the strategy of teaching away from the lecture / providing context model and toward a methodology that emphasizes the need to build, explore, and, examine the implications of our assumptions and decisions about representation. 

**Point 3:** Some more bonus points for the outcomes might be: 
- Understand many of the ways that literature helps society grapple with the meaning and implications of new technologies;
- Expand your skills of critical reading and interpretation, with a particular eye to navigating and filtering information available online;
- Create, analyze, and employ data in support of your ideas;
- Compare typical genres of literature with new forms of interactive media and videogames; 
- and Reflect on your own relationship to IRL and online aspects of life in the digital age.

Flanagan notes, after extrapolating Janet Murray's ([*Hamlet on the Holodeck*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/hamlet-holodeck) 126) definition of agency as the ability to make meaningful choices, that "Artist-created board games use this theory to its fullest, providing table-based mini laboratories for this examination of choice, chance, and social interaction" (Flanagan 116).

"Giacommetti's board games," Flanagan argues, might "offer a critique of even the possibility of agency, implying that playing or enacting the sculptural games boards would be futile, cyclical trap" (Flanagan 116).

"Metaphoric or actual, the game design must embody action, and depending on how active a game feels, its critique may be more or less apparent" (Flanagan 116).

"Like other board games, if a chess set is missing a given piece, it is understood that something else might actin substitution for that piece. Thus, a lofty eraser might be played by an eraser or lipstick . In any event, the piece itself is viewed with its particular affordances and powers, having for both players all of the abilities and limitations of the rules that govern the piece. Using substitute objects in a game in this manner emphasizes that the transactions involved are so symbolically robust that the game's rules and processes can allow for pieces to stand in for one another, for games to forge their won control over temporality, and consensus to be reached among players about how to interact. With these abilities, games produce not only cohesive rule sets but also cohesive worlds, and words that express meaning" (Flanagan 111). This is a key statement because it allows games to function as interpretively creative spaces. In other words, we can have conversations about what object we might pick as a replacement and how these choices are never arbitrary--one can imagine a Drag Queen chess set or representing cultural battles (gay marriage) through the choices we make on the game board. The Chess board then represents all structures of power--short of its rules, the feudal set up and metaphor and organization of the Chess board forces players to confront all hierarchies of representation, not just the transmutation of that hierarchy into replacement objects... the signified becomes embroiled in the Chess hierarchy... the bottle cap cannot be a King and the driftwood must be a pawn suggests the priority of industrial objects over natural objects--or drinks over nature! 

"games are legitimate forms of media, human expression, and cultural importance, and the ways games reflect the norms and beliefs of their surrounding cultures is essential to understanding both games themselves ands the insights they may provide into human experience. In this playculture approach to media, board games become one of several artifacts of material culture used to trace social practices and beliefs. Games actions and rules can be characterized as principle play features, and these foci are not unique to games but are also shared across language systems, social orders, and ties of kinship, law, and ritual" (Flanagan 67). True, and games also expose the inherent bias or social systems (patriarchy, Whiteness, "civilization," moral codes) inherent in the game design or the decisions about how it should be played, or even which rules to follow and which rules to ignore--how someone approaches the game matters--will they follow these rules or not? Why not? Why do they follow them? What are the structures that govern these choices?

"a great deal of pleasure for players can be derived from subverting set interaction norms in both simple play environments and highly complex games. Players will consistently explore what is permissible and why pushes at that boundary between rules and expectations, and a player's own agency, within any given play environment (Flanagan 13).
